# An example illustrating how QD algorithms can automatically discover the feature descriptors of a Grid container.
# Here we use a methodology similar to the AURORA algorithm (Cully2019: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11874.pdf) where an autoencoder is continuously trained during the optimization process on all individuals found so far. The latent space of this autoencoder is used as the feature descriptors of the grid.
# In order to achieve that, grids have to periodically recompute the feature descriptors of all individual found so far. So it implies that all individuals should be stored in additional container. This is achieved in QDpy by using hierarchies of containers, where a (child) container can forward all individuals it encounters to a parent container. Here, the child container is the main Grid, and the parent is an archive containing all individuals found so far.
# Latent spaces of different autoencoders tend to have different domains (e.g. one autoencoder would operate in the [-1., 1.] domain, another on [-5., -1.]) even when they were trained on the same dataset. As such, we use AutoScalingGrid containers instead of just Grid. Such containers periodically adjust their feature descriptors domains to match all previously encountered individuals.
